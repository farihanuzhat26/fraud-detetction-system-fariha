# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based fraud detection system using the [Kaggle credit card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It identifies potentially fraudulent transactions using a Random Forest classifier.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- End-to-end training pipeline in Python (originally built in Google Colab)
- Handles extreme class imbalance using SMOTE
- Evaluates using accuracy, ROC AUC, and classification metrics
- Saves trained model to `fraud_model.pkl` for later use in dashboards or APIs
